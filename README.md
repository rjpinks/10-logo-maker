# Logo Maker

## Description

I created this app to further build upon my node skills. Additionally it exposed me to some XML/SVG files. If I wanted to create a basic logo then this app would be nice.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

## Installation

It is necessairy that the user installs inquirer. I used a earlier version simply because it is what I used in an earlier app.

## Usage

Answer the questions that are prompted when the file is ran. It is important to ensure that your spelling the shape question is accurate or the app will not generate an image. This is also true if you enter more than 3 letters.
